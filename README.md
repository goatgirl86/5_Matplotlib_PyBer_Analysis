# PyBer_Analysis
# Project Overview
## Purpose
The purpose of this week’s assignment was to explore the capabilities charting using Matplotlib and Pandas to analyze and plot ride share data from Pyber.
## Data Analyzed
The specific dataset analyzed included ride share data from January to April 2019 (ride dates, riders, drivers, and city type.  Throughout our weekly modules, we began analyzing the data and creating “practice charts”.  For this challenge, we expanded our analysis by summarizing ride-share data by city type.   
## Deliverables
The deliverables for this assignment were:
1)	Create and format a summary report of ride-share data by city.
2)	Create a multiple-line chart that detailed fares by city type for 2019-01-01 thru 2019-04-28.  
# Results
As you can see from the screenshots below, there is a stark difference between ride-share data in rural, suburban, and urban areas. 
 Rural areas have the fewest total rides, drivers, and total fares.  Suburban areas have more rides, drivers, and fares than rural areas but less than urban areas.  Urban areas significantly trump both suburban and rural areas in overall rides, drivers, and fares.  Regarding average fare per ride and average fare per driver, rural areas have the highest cost for both categories, whereas urban areas are the lowest for both categories.
I attribute these results to these preliminary conclusions:
-	Rural areas have less population to drawn from for both riders and drivers (thus fewer overall rides, drivers, and total fares).  Urban areas, on the other hand, have a vast population with higher supply and demand.
-	Rural areas are more spread out, whereas urban areas are more compact.  Accordingly, rides in rural areas are going to take longer and have high fares per ride than urban areas.
-	Because suburban areas are in between rural and urban areas in their size and population, they also fall in the middle of the ride-share data.

# Summary
Dear Ms. V. Isualize,
As an individual who lives in a rural area myself, I greatly appreciate the honor of analyzing this dataset and having the opportunity to provide you with some business recommendations.  Where I live, there are NO ride-share businesses, and I believe our community could greatly benefit from such enterprise.  It has only been very recently that we have even gotten a city bus that connects our community to one that is 20 minutes away.  Not only would a ride-share business help better connect our communities and citizens, I believe it would cut down on the number of DUIs we have due to people not currently having a different public ride option.  With that being said, here are my recommendations for lessening the disparity in ride-share data between rural and urban areas: 
1)	Increase the number of rural drivers by providing hiring and retention incentives.  The cost of living in some rural areas is very high, so a comparable wage is needed to retain your drivers.
2)	Incentivize riders by giving discounts on their “first” ride or discounts for rides/from popular local events/activities.

3)	Promote (with discounts or incentives) rides between nearby communities.  While the travel distance may be farther than urban rides, traveling between communities in rural areas is more of a necessity than a luxury in many circumstances.  Some individuals may need to drive over 30 minutes to go to the nearest grocery store or restaurant.  

4)	Create targeted advertising in newspapers, post offices, and on targeted social media sites (like community/neighborhood Facebook pages and other community forums).  For example, I know in my small community, nearly everyone who has a Facebook account is a member of the “Grand County Online Garage Sale”.  While this Facebook page may have begun as a simple selling site, it is more of a community chatroom and notice board now.  If you aren’t on Facebook, you read the notices in the paper and post office.
